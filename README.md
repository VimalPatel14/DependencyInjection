# Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a programming technique/principle that aims to minimize the dependencies of a class and makes that class as independent as possible.

Instead of using the dependencies directly, the goal is to minimize the systemâ€™s dependence by injecting required objects. Dependency Injection(DI) simplifies the writing of unit tests and increases code accuracy. Also, loose coupling is one of the essential principles of Object Oriented Design, and one way to achieve loose coupling is Dependency Injection.

# Dagger

Dependency injection is a technique widely used in programming and well suited
to Android development. By following the principles of dependency injection, you
lay the groundwork for a good app architecture.

Implementing dependency injection provides you with the following advantages:
* Reusability of code.
* Ease of refactoring.
* Ease of testing.
* Experience with Kotlin syntax.
* You understand Dependency Injection and know what the benefits of using Dagger in your Android app.
